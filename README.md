Capstone Project Name and Summary:
Dinosaur Match Memory Game App
I made a memory game app where you have to match up the cards to the corresponding dinosaur and match it until there are no cards left. There is also a counter at the bottom that tells you the amount of attempts you've made during that game attempt. 


Technologies Used:

I built my Front-end using React + Vite and CSS to style the application . I broke up my front-end of the app into folders separating components, the different pages and media such as images. I used many different states such as UseEffect and UseState to make states with my game app to consitently have continuity of elements I wanted on the page. I also used React Router to route the different pages to each other, anchor tags and a nav component to make a nav bar, and imported many different files and packages such as clearly react or Axios. I used axios http requests to make a full CRUD API in my front end and made controllers on the back end. On the back end I implemented async and promises as well as used models and schemas to set up my database. I used MongoDb as my database to manage the data coming in and going out and used the Mongoose Driver on top of that.
