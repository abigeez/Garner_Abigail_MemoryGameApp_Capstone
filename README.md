Capstone Project Name:
Dinosaur Match Memory Game App



Project Summary :
I built my Front-end using React + Vite and CSS to style the application . I broke up my front-end of the app into folders separating components, the different pages and media such as images. I used many different states such as UseEffect and UseState to make states with my game app to consitently have continuity of elements I wanted on the page. I also used React Router to route the different pages to each other, anchor tags and a nav component to make a nav bar, and imported many different files and packages such as clearly react or Axios. I used axios http requests to make a full CRUD API in my front end and made controllers on the back end. On the back end I implemented async and promises as well as used models and schemas to set up my database. I used MongoDb as my database to manage the data coming in and going out and used the Mongoose Driver on top of that.
