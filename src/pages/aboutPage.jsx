          I am a Software Engineer who recently graduated from Per Scholas Software Engineering Certification Program. 
          This project was my Capstone project where I had to implement a Full-stack MERN app showcasing all the skills that I've learned during the program. The inspiration behind this game is that Jurassic Park was one of my favorite films growing up! I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it.   </span>
